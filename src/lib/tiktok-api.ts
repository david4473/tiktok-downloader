// This is a simplified example. In a real application, you would need to implement
// a proper API to handle TikTok video downloads, which typically requires a backend service.

export async function downloadTikTokVideo(url: string) {
  // In a real implementation, this would call your backend API
  // which would handle the TikTok video extraction

  // For demonstration purposes, we're returning mock data
  // In a production environment, replace this with actual API calls

  // Simulate API call delay
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1500));

  // Mock response data
  return {
    videoUrl: "https://example.com/video.mp4", // This would be the actual video URL in production
    thumbnail: "/placeholder.svg?height=400&width=300",
    title: "TikTok video - " + url.substring(url.lastIndexOf("/") + 1),
